constraints
  "Electro" => ! "Yes"                     // shared across all regions → will be decontextualized
  "2L"      => "Yes"                       // heavy engine requires coupling → stays contextualized
  "City"    => "White"                     // local rule: city cars are white → stays contextualized
  "City"    => ! "2L"                      // city cars can't have 2L engine → stays contextualized
  "Diesel"  => "White"                     // diesel cars must be white → stays contextualized
  ("City" & "2L") => ! "Yes"               // antecedent impossible due to "City" => ! "2L" → removed in cleanup
