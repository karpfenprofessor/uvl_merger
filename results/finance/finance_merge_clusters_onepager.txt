Finance Model Merge - One Pager Summary

-------------------------------------------------
Clusters (Merge Outcomes)
-------------------------------------------------
Cluster 1 – High overlap, low contextualization (near-duplicates, found in both subgroups)
- Very high share ratio (>90%), aligned constraints.
- Strong reduction (>40%), minimal contextualization.
- Appears in both subgroups as near-duplicates.

Cluster 2 – High overlap, high contextualization (only in Subgroup 2, due to diverging cross-tree logic)
- High share ratio (85–90%), but diverging constraints.
- Moderate reduction (25–30%), many contextualized rules.
- Only occurs in Subgroup 2 (6–10).

Cluster 3 – Low overlap, low contextualization (only cross-group, reflects two distinct product families)
- Low share ratio (50–60%), many unique features.
- Weak reduction (15–20%), contextualization ~12–22%.
- Only occurs across Subgroup 1 ↔ Subgroup 2.

-------------------------------------------------
Subgroups (Model Families)
-------------------------------------------------
Subgroup 1 (Models 2–5)
- Internal merges → Cluster 1 (near-duplicates).

Subgroup 2 (Models 6–10)
- Internal merges → Cluster 1 or Cluster 2 (depends on constraints).

Cross-group (2–5 vs 6–10)
- Always → Cluster 3 (low overlap, low contextualization).
